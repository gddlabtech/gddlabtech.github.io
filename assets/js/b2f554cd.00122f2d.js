You\'ll get the same app either way. When you get it from the App Store, you know that it has passed Apple\'s review and quality control. You receive automatic updates, help cover distribution costs, and support further development. But the Sourceforge link is legit from the developer.\\n\\nA Windows alternative that exists is WinDirStat https://windirstat.info/\\n\\nWhen you download and run the app, select the drive you want to scan, and you\'ll see a screen with a bunch of blocks, with the larger blocks being the larger files and the smaller ones being smaller. This allows you to easily see what files are taking up a lot of space.\\n![Sreenshot of GrandPerspective](../static/img/grand.png)\\n\\nBe very careful when deleting files after you discover large files in this app. Some large files are required for your computer to operate. But video, photos, and other files are great to find here and either move to a backup drive or delete if no longer needed.\\n\\n### Distraction\\nSelfControl\\nhttps://selfcontrolapp.com\\n\\nApparently, the average human attention span is reduced to about **8 Seconds**. Even if we can get down to work, our phones buzz, an email comes in, or something else pops up to distract us. Using an app like SelfControl in conjunction with Do Not Disturb mode can be great for reducing distractions. Even if we open up a web browser to search for stock photos or typefaces, we can sometimes reflexively open up YouTube or other distracting sites.\\n\\nA paid version that I switched to is https://freedom.to/ as it is more robust and can sync across devices.\\n\\n### DarkMode\\nNightOwl\\nhttps://nightowl.kramser.xyz\\n\\nWith dark mode being included on the latest macOS versions, a tool like this makes it super easy to swap dark mode on and off in your menu bar! Simple and sweet.\\n\\n### Organize\\nRectangle\\nhttps://rectangleapp.com/\\n\\nRectangle brings one of my favourite features from Windows to macOS easily snap applications and other windows to a grid on your monitor!\\n![Rectangle Settings](../static/img/rectangle.png)\\n\\n\\n### Zip Files\\nUnarchiver\\nhttps://theunarchiver.com\\n\\nUsing this app allows you to extract RAR, ZIP and TAR files; unlike the built-in mac extractor, it also allows you automatically delete the original compressed files to save space while keeping the extracted files.\\n![Unarchiver Settings](../static/img/zip.png)\\n\\nJust open up the app from your applications folder after installing and set the extraction preferences to your taste.\\n\\n### Actual Uninstaller\\nAppCleaner\\nhttps://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/\\nPairs Well with [GrandPerspective](/blog/utilities#drive-space)\\n\\nSometimes when you uninstall an app, it leaves behind a whole pack of folders hidden away in your system library.

Overall, I ignored this advice, as you get so used to using a mouse for so many years that using another device like a drawing tablet just took too much effort to re-learn habits with it. As I started working full-time as a designer, I wished I was better at using a drawing tablet, but I couldn\'t afford to dedicate the time to learning with it to utilize it to its fullest.  \\n\\nI say all that because I *also* have regretted not learning about markdown text sooner (As a side note, this whole website was written with markdown).\\n\\n### What is Markdown?\\nMarkdown has existed for a long time but started to gain popularity in [2004](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). You can read more about the history of markdown [here](https://capiche.com/e/markdown-history) if you are interested. But basically, it\'s a form of text formatting without the need of a word processor, and loads of things use it. \\n\\n### Why use Markdown?\\n#### Exporting\\nBecause markdown is such a well-supported text format with [a markdown editor](#markdown-apps), you can export to nearly any file format you would need: PDF, rich-text, or even full HTML web-pages. \\n\\n#### Speed\\nIf you are writing HTML pages, writing in markdown can save you time by not worrying about closing tags. No mouse is required as it would be in some text-editors to click **bold** or create a table. But not only that, but the final document is easy to read as the formatting doesn\'t get in the way (unlike actual HTML)!\\n\\n#### Archive and Collaberation\\nIf you\'ve ever created a Microsoft Word document, and years later tried to open it up  only to discover that you don\'t have it installed anymore because you switched to Google Docs or Apple Pages... well, fear not; because markdown is system agnostic, which means it isn\'t actually tied to anything you can open it up in something as simple as a text editor (e.g. notepad.exe or TextEdit.app) or a specific [markdown editor](#markdown-apps)\\n\\n### How to learn Markdown\\nChances are you probably already know some of it and don\'t even know it. If you\'ve ever written a message and tried to `*emphasize*` it by adding Asterix to a word, then you already know a basic markdown. \\n\\nYou can watch two minutes of this video to get the basics:\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6A5EpqqDOdk?start=197\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n:::tip\\nAn easy to follow syntax guide is here: https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax \\n:::\\n\\nOnce you know a bit of markdown, apps you use every day probably already support it to varying extents; [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages), [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-), [Facebook Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/help/147348452522644), and lots of desktop email clients.
